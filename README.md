# Auth Dashboard Frontend

Next.js (App Router) frontend for a role-based authentication API — login, registration, profile management, admin user administration, and automatic token refresh.

Built with **Next.js 16**, **React 19**, **TypeScript**, and **Tailwind CSS 4**.

---

## Features

### Authentication
- Login / Register (registration requires invite code)
- JWT access + refresh token storage in `localStorage`
- Auto-refresh on 401 responses — transparent to callers
- Logout invalidates refresh token server-side

### Dashboard
- Role-aware landing page after login
- **Stats cards** — account age in days, live total user count (with weekly new user delta), email display
- **Quick-links** to Profile Settings and Admin Panel (when role permits)
- **Recent Activity Feed** — client-side log showing login, registration, logout, password changes, and account deletion events. Persisted server-side via the activity API with automatic localStorage fallback when offline. Displayed in reverse-chronological order (last 10), clearable.

### Profile
- View account details
- **Profile Completeness** — progress bar with checklist (username, email, password changed), suggests changing password to reach 100%
- Change password (logged as activity event)
- Delete account (with confirmation, redirects to login, logged as activity event)

### Dark / Light Mode
- 🌙/☀️ toggle button in the navigation bar
- Persists preference to `localStorage`
- Respects system `prefers-color-scheme` on first visit
- Applies Tailwind `dark:` variant across all pages and components

### Admin / Moderator Panel
- Accessible to ADMIN and MODERATOR roles (title adapts to role)
- **Invite code generator** — count input (1–10), Generate button, auto-copy to clipboard, Copy All, read-only textarea display
- **Paginated user list** (10 per page, ADMIN only)
- **Role management** (ADMIN only) — change roles: USER / DONATOR / MODERATOR / ADMIN (self-role protected)
- **Delete users** (ADMIN only, self-delete protected)
- Action feedback messages

### Navigation
- Top nav bar with role-aware links
- Admin Panel link visible to ADMIN and MODERATOR
- Displays current username and role badge
- Logout button

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 20+
- A running instance of the [auth API backend](https://github.com/your-org/your-auth-api)

### Environment

Copy `.env.example` to `.env.local` in the project root and adjust as needed:

```bash
cp .env.example .env.local
```

### Install & Run

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

### Build

```bash
npm run build
npm run lint
```

## Activity Feed

Activity events (login, registration, logout, password changes, account deletion) are logged server-side via `POST /api/activity` in a fire-and-forget pattern — the UI never waits for the API call. The dashboard fetches the feed from `GET /api/activity` on mount, falling back to `localStorage` if the API is unreachable. If the API call fails, the event is also persisted to `localStorage` as a secondary fallback, ensuring the feed works offline.

| Event Type | Icon | Label |
|-----------|------|-------|
| `login` | 🔑 | Logged in |
| `register` | 📝 | Created account |
| `logout` | 🚪 | Logged out |
| `password_change` | 🔐 | Changed password |
| `account_delete` | 🗑️ | Deleted account |

---

## Auth Flow

1. User logs in → server returns `{ accessToken, refreshToken }` → stored in `localStorage`
2. Subsequent API calls attach `Authorization: Bearer <accessToken>` header (via `authFetch`)
3. If a 401 is returned, the client automatically calls `/api/auth/refresh` with the stored refresh token
4. On success → new tokens saved → original request retried
5. On refresh failure → tokens cleared → redirect to `/`

---

## Role System

| Role | Capabilities |
|------|-------------|
| USER | Dashboard (stats, activity feed), Profile (completeness, password change) |
| DONATOR | Dashboard (stats, activity feed), Profile (completeness, password change) |
| MODERATOR | Dashboard, Profile, Admin Panel (invite code generation) |
| ADMIN | Dashboard, Profile, Admin Panel (invite codes, user list, role changes, user deletion) |

Route guards redirect unauthorized users:
- `/dashboard` → redirects to `/` if not logged in
- `/dashboard/admin` → redirects to `/dashboard` if not ADMIN or MODERATOR
- `/profile` → redirects to `/` if not logged in
- `/` → redirects to `/dashboard` or `/dashboard/admin` if already logged in
